# NFT-based-Fan-Engagement-Platform
Create a WEB3-based platform for celebrities and influencers to engage with their fans through exclusive NFT-gated content and experiences.
# Given the project description, here's a demo-level Python code snippet that outlines a basic structure for an NFT-based Fan Engagement Platform.
# This example uses Flask for the web server and Web3.py for interacting with Ethereum blockchain.
# Please note, for simplicity, the blockchain interaction part is highly abstracted.

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from web3 import Web3

app = Flask(__name__)

# Setup Web3. Replace 'your_infura_project_url' with your actual Infura project URL or your preferred Ethereum node access point.
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('your_infura_project_url'))

# This function simulates checking if a user owns a specific NFT
def check_nft_ownership(user_address, contract_address, token_id):
    # For demonstration, this is a stub. You would use Web3.py here to interact with the smart contract
    # to verify if the user_address owns the NFT (token_id) from the contract_address.
    return True

@app.route('/exclusive-content', methods=['GET'])
def get_exclusive_content():
    user_address = request.args.get('user_address')
    contract_address = request.args.get('contract_address')
    token_id = request.args.get('token_id')
    
    # Check if the user owns the required NFT
    if check_nft_ownership(user_address, contract_address, token_id):
        # For demonstration, just return a simple message. In a real app, this would return exclusive content or experiences.
        return jsonify({'status': 'success', 'message': 'Welcome to the exclusive content area!'})
    else:
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': 'You do not own the required NFT to access this content.'}), 403

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

# Note: This code is for demonstration purposes and not ready for production use.
# It lacks proper error handling, validation, and security features which are crucial for a real-world application.
# Also, interacting with blockchain requires a deeper implementation based on the specific smart contract you're interacting with.
